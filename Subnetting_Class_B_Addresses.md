# Use the same subnet numbers for the third octet with Class B that you used for the fourth octet with Class C, but add a 0 to the network portion and a 255 to the broadcast section in the fourth octet.

## Practice Example #1B: 255.255.128.0 /17
Network Address: 172.16.0.0
Subnet Mask: 255.255.128.0

1) Subnets? 2^x 128 = 10000000. 2^1 = 2
2) Hosts? 2^y-2, 2^15-2
